# TSPUDTTY : The Stanley Parable Ultra Deluxe TeleTYpe

Ever have that problem where you want to play The Stanley Parable but:

1. Your computer only runs Windows 3.11, you old fart
2. You really like text adventures, and don't play graphical games
3. You don't own Windows

Worry not! I have the solution.
Just download Python, and run main.py!
